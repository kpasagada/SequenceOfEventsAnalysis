# Sequence Of Events Analysis

Given a certain sequence of CAMEO (Conflict and Mediation Event Observations)  events, we have to tell whether they resemble a previously happened event scenario and do prediction task on the outcome of that event. The focus of this project is to analyze these encoded political activities/events in Source-Action-Target (SAT) format and predict the action part of the event based on previously seen event data.
